# Ralph Loop State — EarnedOut Overnight Search Revamp

This file is the loop's control state. Read it first, every iteration.

Stage `status` values: `not_started` → `implemented` → `self_tested` → `verified`
(`blocked` = waiting on an external dependency recorded in `BLOCKERS.md`).

## Iteration history
- Iteration 1 (2026-05-20T23:32:12Z): Bootstrapped `_ralph/`. Ran IMPLEMENT on
  `s1_repo` — workspace tree + prospect-evaluation skill migration + git origin
  verified; local commit `780edfe` succeeded. `git push` failed (sandbox cannot
  reach the SSH remote) → recorded as finding F1. `s1_repo` → `implemented`,
  `unresolved_findings` → 1. See `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` / `FINDINGS.md`.

## Next iteration (expected)
RESOLVE phase: `unresolved_findings == 1` → take finding F1, reclassify the
GitHub-push failure as an external blocker (move to `BLOCKERS.md`). Then the
IMPLEMENT scan resumes at `s2_playwright`.

## Environment notes (read before every git commit)
The loop's execution sandbox mounts the workspace with a filesystem that
**permits create/write/rename but blocks `unlink` inside `.git/`**. Consequence:
- A plain `git add` / `git commit` works *once* when no stale lock exists, but
  any aborted or read-only git op (e.g. `git status`) can leave an orphan
  `*.lock` file that cannot be deleted and blocks the next git command.
- **Workaround — run before every commit:** rename every stale lock aside, then
  commit in a single invocation:
  ```bash
  cd <workspace bash path> && \
    find .git -name '*.lock' ! -name '*.stale-*' -print | \
      while read -r f; do mv "$f" "$f.stale-$(date +%s%N)"; done; \
    git -c user.name="Ralph Loop" -c user.email="ralph@earnedout.local" \
      commit -a -m "<msg>"   # use commit -a; if new untracked files exist,
                             # rename locks aside again, then git add -A first
  ```
- `git push` additionally fails (see finding F1 / BLOCKERS): SSH remote
  unreachable from the sandbox. Local commits still persist — the `.git` lives
  in Biffrey's real, persistent folder — so loop continuity is unaffected.
