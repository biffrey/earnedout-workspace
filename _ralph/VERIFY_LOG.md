# VERIFY_LOG — independent verification output

Full output of each VERIFY critic subagent and the FINAL AUDIT subagent.

## Iteration 20 — s1_repo verify

**Phase:** VERIFY. **Stage:** `s1_repo` (Repository setup & migration).
**Selection:** `unresolved_findings == 0` → Step 1 fell through RESOLVE; the
IMPLEMENT scan found no actionable `not_started` stage (s9 needs s1–s8 all
`verified`, s10 needs s9 `verified`); the SELF-TEST scan found no `implemented`
stage (s1/s2/s4/s5/s6/s7/s8 are `self_tested`, s3 is `blocked`) → fell through
to VERIFY. The VERIFY s1→s10 scan landed on the first `self_tested` stage,
`s1_repo`. Counting blocker B1 (`op` CLI) re-checked at Step 1 — `op --version`
→ `op: command not found` (exit 127), `which op` exit 1 in the iteration-20
sandbox; precondition did not clear, B1 stays open, `open_blockers` stays 1.

**Method:** Spawned an independent general-purpose critic subagent (Appendix C
brief): skeptical fresh context, read `REVAMP_PLAN.md` "Repository
Reorganization" + "Implementation Order" #1, the `TEST_LOG.md` Iteration 12
s1_repo self-test entry, `FINDINGS.md` F1, and `STATE.md` Environment notes;
directed to independently re-run at least one of the three Appendix A Stage 1
SELF-TEST checks and report what it actually observed; read-only (no file
mutations).

**Subagent verdict: `SHIP` — no BLOCKING findings.**

> VERDICT: SHIP

### Loop disposition of the subagent output

Verdict is `SHIP` with **zero BLOCKING findings**, so per loop-prompt Step 1.4
`s1_repo` → `verified`. The two `IMPROVE` items were reviewed and neither is a
new actionable defect of s1, so `unresolved_findings` is NOT incremented (the
"write each BLOCKING/IMPROVE finding to FINDINGS.md" instruction applies only on
the `REVISE`/BLOCKING branch):
- IMPROVE #3 (`git status` dirty): the lone dirty file is `_ralph/STATE.md`, this
  very iteration's own in-progress edit — not an s1 artifact. It is committed at
  the end of this iteration as normal loop flow. Not a defect; no finding.
- IMPROVE #5 (`git push` never succeeded): this IS finding F1, already raised
  (iter 1) and resolved via Option C (iter 2). The subagent explicitly "accept[s]
  it as documented." Not a new finding — F1 already stands as the durable record,
  and STATE.md Environment notes already carry the user-facing note that the
  GitHub mirror is stale and a manual `git push` from Biffrey's Mac is needed.
- NIT #4 (stale `git log` snippet) and NIT #6 (prospect-evaluation `name` is
  title-case): #4 is informational (evidence real when written); #6 is explicitly
  out of s1's "migrate as-is" scope per the subagent. Neither is recorded as a
  finding; #6 is noted here for a future cosmetic cleanup if desired.

All three Appendix A Stage 1 SELF-TEST checks were independently re-run by the
critic and observed to genuinely pass against the real filesystem and git repo.
**`s1_repo` → `verified`.**

## Iteration 21 — s2_playwright verify

**Phase:** VERIFY. **Stage:** `s2_playwright` (Playwright MCP setup).
**Selection:** Step 1 blocker re-check — counting blocker B1 (`op` CLI) still
open: `op --version` → `op: command not found` (exit 127), `which op` exit 1 in
the iteration-21 sandbox; precondition (an installed, signed-in `op` reachable
by the SELF-TEST) did not clear, so B1 stays open and `open_blockers` stays 1.
`unresolved_findings == 0` → Step 1 fell through RESOLVE; the IMPLEMENT scan
found no actionable `not_started` stage (s9 needs s1–s8 all `verified`, s10
needs s9 `verified`); the SELF-TEST scan found no `implemented` stage (s1 is
`verified`, s2/s4/s5/s6/s7/s8 are `self_tested`, s3 is `blocked`) → fell
through to VERIFY. The VERIFY s1→s10 scan skipped `s1_repo` (`verified`) and
landed on the first `self_tested` stage, `s2_playwright`.

**Method:** Spawned an independent general-purpose critic subagent (Appendix C
brief): skeptical fresh context, directed to read `REVAMP_PLAN.md` "Step 0 —
Prerequisites" + "Implementation Order" #2, the `TEST_LOG.md` Iteration 13
s2_playwright self-test entry, `BLOCKERS.md` advisory A1, and
`.claude/settings.json`; instructed to independently re-run at least one of the
three mandatory Appendix A Stage 2 SELF-TEST checks (Check 1 minimum) and report
exactly what it observed; read-only (no workspace file mutations).

**Subagent verdict: `SHIP` — no BLOCKING findings.**

>
> **4. Check 4 (live MCP navigation) — CORRECTLY SKIPPED (no severity).** No

### Loop disposition of the subagent output

Verdict is `SHIP` with **zero BLOCKING findings**, so per loop-prompt Step 1.4
`s2_playwright` → `verified`. The critic independently re-ran all three
mandatory Appendix A Stage 2 SELF-TEST checks from a clean ephemeral sandbox —
Check 1 (settings.json parses + has the `playwright` server), Check 2
(`@playwright/mcp@0.0.75` reinstalled and confirmed by `npm ls -g`), and Check 3
(Chromium reinstalled, headless launch + render + non-empty PNG screenshot) —
and observed each genuinely pass; it also confirmed the TEST_LOG Iteration 13
evidence is truthful and re-derivable, with no faked PASS.

`unresolved_findings` is NOT incremented: the only graded item is finding #6,
severity **NIT** — the loop-prompt Step 1.4 "write each BLOCKING/IMPROVE finding
to FINDINGS.md" instruction applies only to the `REVISE`/BLOCKING branch and, in
any case, only to BLOCKING/IMPROVE severities. NIT #6 (plan example shows
`@playwright/mcp` untagged vs. the on-disk `@playwright/mcp@latest`) is recorded
here for transparency only — the subagent itself rates it "functionally
equivalent ... not a defect ... no fix required for ship." Findings #1–#5 are
explicit "no severity" confirmations. Advisory note A1 (`mcp__playwright__*`
tools require a Cowork restart) remains non-counting and correctly excluded from
`open_blockers`; the critic independently confirmed the absence of those MCP
tools and agreed Check 4's conditional skip is by-design, not a failure.

All three mandatory Appendix A Stage 2 SELF-TEST checks were independently
re-run by the critic and observed to genuinely pass.
**`s2_playwright` → `verified`.**

## Iteration 22 — s4_airtable verify

**Phase:** VERIFY. **Stage:** `s4_airtable` (Airtable field creation).
**Selection:** Step 1 blocker re-check — counting blocker B1 (`op` CLI) still
open: `op --version` → `op: command not found` (exit 127), `which op` exit 1 in
the iteration-22 sandbox; precondition (an installed, signed-in `op` reachable
by the SELF-TEST) did not clear, so B1 stays open and `open_blockers` stays 1.
`unresolved_findings == 0` → Step 1 fell through RESOLVE; the IMPLEMENT scan
found no actionable `not_started` stage (s9 needs s1–s8 all `verified`, s10
needs s9 `verified`); the SELF-TEST scan found no `implemented` stage (s1/s2 are
`verified`, s4/s5/s6/s7/s8 are `self_tested`, s3 is `blocked`) → fell through to
VERIFY. The VERIFY s1→s10 scan skipped `s1_repo` and `s2_playwright`
(`verified`) and `s3_onepassword` (`blocked`, not `self_tested`) and landed on
the first `self_tested` stage, `s4_airtable`.

**Method:** Spawned an independent general-purpose critic subagent (Appendix C
brief): skeptical fresh context, directed to read `REVAMP_PLAN.md` "Step 1 —
New Airtable Fields" + "Implementation Order" #4, the `TEST_LOG.md` Iteration 15
s4_airtable self-test entry, and `FINDINGS.md` finding F3 (financial-field
naming reconciliation); instructed to independently re-list the live Airtable
schema of table `tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS` in base `appOsvuyy5eK43QTx` via the Airtable
MCP, confirm all 16 new fields exist with correct types, confirm the three
single-select option sets match the plan exactly, confirm key pre-existing
fields are retained, and report the actual field IDs/types it observed;
read-only (explicitly told not to create/modify/delete any Airtable fields or
records).

**Subagent verdict: `SHIP` — no BLOCKING findings.**

### Loop disposition of the subagent output

Verdict is `SHIP` with **zero BLOCKING findings**, so per loop-prompt Step 1.4
`s4_airtable` → `verified`. The critic independently re-listed the live Airtable
schema of `tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS` / `appOsvuyy5eK43QTx` via the Airtable MCP and
confirmed, with its own observed field IDs and types, that (a) all 16 plan
Step-1 fields exist with correct types, (b) the three single-select option sets
match the plan exactly (Disposition 6/6, Link Health Status 3/3, Source 2/2),
(c) key pre-existing fields are retained including the Links field
`fldwo7ui7aIGoMxAG`, and (d) the TEST_LOG Iteration 15 evidence is genuine and
re-derivable byte-for-byte — no faked PASS.

`unresolved_findings` is NOT incremented: the only two graded items are findings
#4 and #6, both severity **NIT** — the loop-prompt Step 1.4 "write each
BLOCKING/IMPROVE finding to FINDINGS.md" instruction applies only on the
`REVISE`/BLOCKING branch and, in any case, only to BLOCKING/IMPROVE severities.
NIT #4 (live field "Priority Geography?" vs. plan's "Priority Geography" — a
trailing-"?" variance on a *pre-existing* field, explicitly out of s4's
16-new-field IMPLEMENT scope, already honestly disclosed in TEST_LOG Iteration
15) and NIT #6 (TEST_LOG prose imprecision attributing precision detail to
`list_tables_for_base` rather than `get_table_schema` — the checks were
genuinely run and the conclusions correct) are recorded here for transparency
only; neither is a defect of s4's implemented substance. Findings #1, #2, #3, #5
are explicit "no severity" confirmations.

Both Appendix A Stage 4 SELF-TEST checks were independently re-run by the critic
against the live Airtable schema and observed to genuinely pass.
**`s4_airtable` → `verified`.**

## Iteration 23 — s5_overnight_skill verify

VERIFY phase. Step 1 fell through RESOLVE (`unresolved_findings == 0`), the
IMPLEMENT scan (no actionable `not_started` stage — s9 needs s1–s8 all
`verified`, s10 needs s9 `verified`), and the SELF-TEST scan (no `implemented`
stage — s1/s2/s4 `verified`, s5/s6/s7/s8 `self_tested`, s3 `blocked`) to
**VERIFY**. The VERIFY s1→s10 scan skipped `s1_repo`/`s2_playwright`/
`s4_airtable` (`verified`) and `s3_onepassword` (`blocked`, not `self_tested`)
and landed on the first `self_tested` stage, `s5_overnight_skill`.

Spawned an independent general-purpose critic subagent (Appendix C brief):
skeptical fresh context, instructed to read `REVAMP_PLAN.md` Steps 2 (2a–2e),
3, 4, 5, 7, 8 + "Implementation Order" #5 and `TEST_LOG.md` Iteration 16,
verify the artifact `.claude/skills/overnight-search/skill.md`, independently
re-run at least one SELF-TEST check, and flag any unbacked PASS; read-only.

### Loop decision — Iteration 23

Critic verdict: **SHIP**, zero BLOCKING findings. The only graded items are
findings #3 and #7, both severity **NIT**, plus #9 (NIT, TEST_LOG metadata
drift); findings #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #8 are explicit "no severity"
confirmations. The critic independently re-ran SELF-TEST Check 1
(`yaml.safe_load` of the frontmatter → dict with exactly `name`/`description`,
584-char description) and Check 3 (`grep` of base/table/Links IDs, the 16 new
field names incl. F3-canonical `Revenue/Cash Flow 2024/2025`, the
never-store-search-URL rule at L55–56, the price-drop logic at L102–110), and
confirmed `TEST_LOG.md` Iteration 16's PASS claims are honest and
line-citation-accurate — no unbacked PASS.

Per loop-prompt Step 1.4 (SHIP verdict + no BLOCKING finding → set `verified`),
`s5_overnight_skill` → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` is NOT incremented:
the "write each BLOCKING/IMPROVE finding to FINDINGS.md" instruction applies
only on the `REVISE`/BLOCKING branch and, in any case, only to BLOCKING/IMPROVE
severities — the three NITs (#3, #7, #9) do not qualify and are recorded here
for transparency only. None is a defect of s5's implemented substance.

All three Appendix A Stage 5 SELF-TEST checks were independently re-run by the
critic against the real `skill.md` file and observed to genuinely pass.
**`s5_overnight_skill` → `verified`.**

## Iteration 24 — s6_submit_url verify

**Phase:** VERIFY. **Timestamp:** 2026-05-21T03:54:31Z.
**Stage selected:** `s6_submit_url`. Step 1 blocker re-check: counting blocker
B1 (`op` CLI) still open — `op --version` → `op: command not found` (exit 127),
`which op` exit 1 in the iteration-24 sandbox; precondition (an installed,
signed-in `op` reachable by the SELF-TEST) did not clear, so B1 stays open and
`open_blockers` stays 1. `unresolved_findings == 0` so Step 1 fell through
RESOLVE; the IMPLEMENT scan found no actionable `not_started` stage (s9 needs
s1–s8 all `verified`, s10 needs s9 `verified`); the SELF-TEST scan found no
`implemented` stage (s1/s2/s4/s5 `verified`, s6/s7/s8 `self_tested`, s3
`blocked`) so Step 1 fell through to **VERIFY**. The VERIFY s1→s10 scan skipped
`s1_repo`/`s2_playwright`/`s4_airtable`/`s5_overnight_skill` (`verified`) and
`s3_onepassword` (`blocked`, not `self_tested`) and landed on the first
`self_tested` stage, `s6_submit_url`.

An independent general-purpose critic subagent was spawned with the Appendix C
brief: skeptical fresh context, instructed to read `REVAMP_PLAN.md` "Step 6",
the loop's `_ralph/TEST_LOG.md` Iteration 17 entry, and the artifact
`.claude/skills/submit-url/skill.md`; explicitly read-only (no file or Airtable
mutation). Full critic output follows verbatim.

---

### Critic subagent output (verbatim)

## Verification Findings: s6_submit_url

**1. [INFO] Existence & completeness — PASS.** `.claude/skills/submit-url/skill.md`
exists (11,091 bytes, 153 lines). Frontmatter parses as a valid YAML dict via
`yaml.safe_load` with exactly two keys: `name: 'submit-url'` (exact slug
required by plan) and a 590-char `description` that faithfully covers the plan
Step 6 workflow (Playwright validation + screenshot, data extraction, dedup
with price-drop detection, prospect-evaluation scoring, Airtable record with
`Source = "Manual Submission"`, outreach draft, dashboard regen, score report)
plus trigger phrases. The plan's literal description is a shorter sentence; the
file's is a plan-faithful expansion — acceptable.

**2. [INFO] All 9 workflow steps present, in order — PASS.**
`grep -nE '^## Step [0-9]'` returns exactly 9 headings numbered 1→9: Accept URL
(L19), Validate/Playwright (L26), Extract Data (L34), Dedup+Price-Drop (L46),
Prospect-Eval (L65), Airtable record (L74), Broker Outreach (L110), Regenerate
Dashboard (L125), Report to User (L135). Each maps 1:1 to plan Step 6 items 1–9.

**3. [INFO] Overnight-search cross-references are consistent — PASS.** Every
cross-reference in submit-url resolves to the correct overnight-search heading:
skill Step 2→overnight Step 3 (L58), Step 3→Step 4 (L68), Step 4→Step 5 (L88),
Step 5→Step 6 (L112), Step 6→Step 7 (L123), Step 7→Step 8 (L159), Step 8→Step 10
(L188), and L24's "overnight-search skill Step 2" → L36 Search platforms. All 8
line numbers in the TEST_LOG cross-ref table I independently confirmed by
`grep`. No dangling references.

**4. [INFO] `Source = "Manual Submission"` — PASS.** `grep -n 'Manual
Submission'` returns 4 hits: frontmatter (L3), intro (L8), Step 6 heading (L74),
the operative field mapping at L95 (`Source` → "Manual Submission", explicitly
contrasted with overnight-search's "Overnight Search"), and the Notes block at
L102. Plan Step 6 requirement satisfied.

**5. [INFO] Required-coverage checklist — PASS.** The skill covers all plan
Step 6 elements: one URL accepted (L19–24, with search-results rejection),
Playwright validation (L26–32), data extraction incl. 2024/2025 financials and
"do not fabricate" (L34–44), dedup with full 3-branch price-drop logic and
`Previous Asking Price` (L46–63), prospect-evaluation invocation (L65–72),
Airtable create/update with all 16 new fields under F3-canonical names
`Revenue 2024/2025`, `Cash Flow 2024/2025` (L74–108), conditional broker
outreach (L110–123, correctly drafts only if broker info exists), dashboard
regen (L125–133), score+summary display (L135–145). Bonus Error Handling
section (L147–153).

**6. [INFO] Truth of testing — Iteration 17 evidence is REAL, not hand-waving.**
TEST_LOG Iteration 17 cites concrete commands (`yaml.safe_load`,
`grep -nE '^## Step [0-9]'`, `grep -n 'Manual Submission'`) with specific output
(parsed dict, 2 keys, name `submit-url`, description length 590, 9 step
headings, 4 grep hits). I independently re-ran all three checks: every claimed
value matches exactly — `name: 'submit-url'`, `description length: 590`, exactly
9 ordered `## Step N` headings at the cited lines, 4 `Manual Submission` hits.
No PASS in Iteration 17 is unsupported.

**7. [NIT] TEST_LOG phase-selection note slightly inconsistent across
iterations** — Iter 17 says `op --version` exit 127 while Iter 16 says exit 1.
Cosmetic discrepancy in a blocker re-check note unrelated to s6; not
load-bearing. Suggested fix: none required.

**8. [NIT] Iteration 17 was self-test only; no VERIFY/critic pass yet for s6** —
git log shows iters 20–23 verified s1, s2, s4, s5 but s6 sits at `self_tested`,
not `verified`. This is the expected loop ordering, not a defect — it is
precisely why this independent verification was commissioned. No fix needed.

No BLOCKING or IMPROVE findings. The artifact fully matches plan Step 6, the
Iteration 17 self-test was genuinely executed with reproducible evidence, and my
independent re-checks reproduce every claimed result. This is read-only
verification; no files or Airtable records were modified.

VERDICT: SHIP

---

### Loop disposition (iteration 24)

The critic returned **`VERDICT: SHIP` with zero BLOCKING and zero IMPROVE
findings.** It independently re-ran all three Appendix A Stage 6 SELF-TEST
checks against the real `.claude/skills/submit-url/skill.md` — frontmatter
`yaml.safe_load` (dict, exactly `name`=`submit-url` + 590-char `description`),
the 9 ordered `## Step N` headings, and the 4 `Manual Submission` hits — and
reproduced every value claimed in `TEST_LOG.md` Iteration 17 exactly, confirming
that self-test was genuinely executed (no faked PASS).

Per loop-prompt Step 1.4 (SHIP verdict + no BLOCKING finding → set `verified`),
`s6_submit_url` → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` is NOT incremented: the
"write each BLOCKING/IMPROVE finding to FINDINGS.md" instruction applies only on
the `REVISE`/BLOCKING branch and, in any case, only to BLOCKING/IMPROVE
severities — the two NITs (#7, #8) do not qualify and are recorded here for
transparency only. NIT #7 is an immaterial cross-iteration metadata wording
drift in a blocker re-check note (the `op` check genuinely fails either way; the
exit code reported can legitimately differ run-to-run depending on how the
shell surfaces the missing command); NIT #8 simply describes this very VERIFY
phase being the expected next step. Neither is a defect of s6's implemented
substance.

All three Appendix A Stage 6 SELF-TEST checks were independently re-run by the
critic against the real `skill.md` file and observed to genuinely pass.
**`s6_submit_url` → `verified`.**

## Iteration 25 — s7_outreach verify

**Phase:** VERIFY. **Stage:** `s7_outreach` (Broker outreach templates).
**Selection:** Step 1 blocker re-check — counting blocker B1 (`op` CLI) still
open: `op --version` → `op: command not found` (exit 127), `which op` exit 1 in
the iteration-25 sandbox; precondition (an installed, signed-in `op` reachable
by the SELF-TEST) did not clear, so B1 stays open and `open_blockers` stays 1.
`unresolved_findings == 0` → Step 1 fell through RESOLVE; the IMPLEMENT scan
found no actionable `not_started` stage (s9 needs s1–s8 all `verified`, s10
needs s9 `verified`); the SELF-TEST scan found no `implemented` stage
(s1/s2/s4/s5/s6 `verified`, s7/s8 `self_tested`, s3 `blocked`) → fell through to
VERIFY. The VERIFY s1→s10 scan skipped `s1_repo`/`s2_playwright`/`s4_airtable`/
`s5_overnight_skill`/`s6_submit_url` (`verified`) and `s3_onepassword`
(`blocked`, not `self_tested`) and landed on the first `self_tested` stage,
`s7_outreach`.

An independent general-purpose critic subagent was spawned with the Appendix C
brief: skeptical fresh context, instructed to read `REVAMP_PLAN.md` "Step 5",
`_ralph/TEST_LOG.md` Iteration 18 (s7_outreach self-test), the artifact
`config/outreach_templates.md`, and `_ralph/FINDINGS.md`; read-only.

### Loop decision

Critic verdict: **`SHIP`**, zero BLOCKING findings, zero IMPROVE findings. The
two graded items are NITs — both explicitly flagged "No fix needed" by the
critic — describing deliberate, correct adaptations (Template D's anchored
subject; lifting Template A's subject into a separate section to enable the
plan-mandated subject-only A/B). The critic independently re-ran SELF-TEST
checks (`wc -l` → 277, `grep -nE '^##'` confirming all seven header line
citations) and reproduced TEST_LOG Iteration 18's evidence exactly — no faked
PASS. Per Step 1.4 (SHIP + no BLOCKING → `verified`), `s7_outreach` →
`verified`. `unresolved_findings` is NOT incremented: the
"write each BLOCKING/IMPROVE finding to FINDINGS.md" instruction applies only on
the `REVISE`/BLOCKING branch and only to BLOCKING/IMPROVE severities — the two
NITs do not qualify and are recorded here for transparency only.

All six Appendix A Stage 7 SELF-TEST checks were independently confirmed by the
critic against the real `config/outreach_templates.md` file.
**`s7_outreach` → `verified`.**

---

## Iteration 26 — s8_dashboard verify

**Phase:** VERIFY. **Stage:** `s8_dashboard` (was `self_tested`).
**Timestamp:** 2026-05-21T04:14:36Z

Step 1 blocker re-check: counting blocker B1 (`op` CLI) still open — `op
--version` → `op: command not found` (exit 127), `which op` exit 1 in the
iteration-26 sandbox. Precondition (an installed, signed-in `op` reachable by
the SELF-TEST) did not clear, so B1 stays open, `open_blockers` stays 1.
`unresolved_findings == 0` → Step 1 fell through RESOLVE; the IMPLEMENT scan
found no actionable `not_started` stage (s9 needs s1–s8 `verified`, s10 needs s9
`verified`); the SELF-TEST scan found no `implemented` stage (s1/s2/s4/s5/s6/s7
`verified`, s3 `blocked`, s8 `self_tested`) → fell through to VERIFY. The VERIFY
s1→s10 scan skipped `s1_repo`/`s2_playwright`/`s4_airtable`/`s5_overnight_skill`/
`s6_submit_url`/`s7_outreach` (`verified`) and `s3_onepassword` (`blocked`, not
`self_tested`) and landed on the first `self_tested` stage, `s8_dashboard`.

Spawned an independent general-purpose critic subagent (Appendix C brief):
skeptical fresh context, told to read `REVAMP_PLAN.md` "Step 7" +
"Implementation Order" #8, `_ralph/TEST_LOG.md` Iteration 19, the artifact
`templates/daily-dashboard.html`, `templates/single-report.html`, and the
committed evidence under `_ralph/evidence/iter19/`; read-only (no file
modification).

### Loop decision

Critic verdict: **`SHIP`**, zero BLOCKING findings, zero IMPROVE findings. The
only graded item is NIT #6, explicitly flagged "No fix needed" by the critic
(an observation that all three table sections share a 9-column layout, so the
`colspan="9"` empty-state rows are consistent — not a defect). Findings #1–#5
are "no severity" PASS confirmations. The critic independently re-ran the Stage
8 SELF-TEST: it installed `jinja2 3.0.3` and rendered the real
`templates/daily-dashboard.html` with both a populated and an all-empty context,
confirmed both renders are tag-balanced with no leftover Jinja delimiters,
verified all four sections / the price-drop badge / the Date Added column / the
four empty-state strings, confirmed the `:root` CSS palette is byte-identical to
`single-report.html`, and viewed the committed 188,486-byte
`_ralph/evidence/iter19/dashboard_render.png` screenshot — no faked PASS in
TEST_LOG Iteration 19. Per Step 1.4 (SHIP + no BLOCKING → `verified`),
`s8_dashboard` → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` is NOT incremented: the
"write each BLOCKING/IMPROVE finding to FINDINGS.md" instruction applies only on
the `REVISE`/BLOCKING branch and only to BLOCKING/IMPROVE severities — NIT #6
does not qualify and is recorded here for transparency only.

Both Appendix A Stage 8 SELF-TEST checks were independently confirmed by the
critic against the real `templates/daily-dashboard.html` file.
**`s8_dashboard` → `verified`.**

## Iteration 42 — s3_onepassword verify

Phase: VERIFY. Stage: `s3_onepassword`. Run at 2026-05-21T14:57:30Z.
Selection: Step 1 blocker re-check — B1 already RESOLVED (2026-05-21 operator
manual review), `open_blockers == 0`, no pending precondition.
`unresolved_findings == 0` → RESOLVE skipped. IMPLEMENT — no `not_started` stage
with met dependencies (`s9_end_to_end` needs s1–s8 ALL `verified`, but
`s3_onepassword` was `self_tested`; `s10_schedule` needs s9). SELF-TEST — no
`implemented` stage. VERIFY — the s1→s10 scan skipped s1/s2/s4/s5/s6/s7/s8
(`verified`) and landed on the first `self_tested` stage, `s3_onepassword`.

Spawned an independent general-purpose critic subagent (Appendix C brief):
skeptical fresh context, READ-ONLY, briefed to read `REVAMP_PLAN.md` Step 0
(1Password portion), `REVAMP_LOOP_PROMPT.md` Appendix A Stage 3, `TEST_LOG.md`
Iteration 41, `BLOCKERS.md` B1, `FINDINGS.md` F2, `config/credentials-setup.md`,
and `_ralph/evidence/s3_op_verification_2026-05-21.md`. It was explicitly told
the structural fact that `op` is a desktop tool absent from the ephemeral Linux
sandbox, that Appendix A Stage 3 Check 2 was deliberately rewritten to confirm
the operator-evidence file rather than re-run `op`, and that its job is to judge
whether that evidence is genuine and whether the loop's acceptance is honest.

### Critic output (verbatim)

> ## Verification Findings — s3_onepassword

It must never: proceed to DealStream unauthenticated... fall back to cached, blank, or hard-coded credentials." Line 78 confirms a startup auth check (`op whoami` or trial `op read`). This fully matches the plan's REVAMP_PLAN.md:113 requirement.

> **2. Path consistency across all sources — PASS.** `op://Personal/dealstream.com/...` is identical in REVAMP_PLAN.md:110–111, config/credentials-setup.md:35–37, REVAMP_LOOP_PROMPT.md Appendix A Stage 3 (line 184) and Appendix B (line 281), BLOCKERS.md B1 (line 35), FINDINGS.md F2 addendum (line 143), and the evidence file (line 56). The superseded `op://Private/DealStream/...` only appears as explicitly-labeled "original, wrong" history. No internal contradiction.
>
> **3. SELF-TEST Check 1 — independently re-verified, genuinely PASS.** I opened `config/credentials-setup.md` directly and confirmed exactly what TEST_LOG Iteration 41 (lines 752–771) claims. The TEST_LOG line citations (34–37, 67–78) match the real file. This is a real check, not hand-waving.
>
> **4. SELF-TEST Check 2 / evidence provenance — PASS, and the loop's acceptance is honest.** Git confirms `_ralph/evidence/s3_op_verification_2026-05-21.md` was created in commit `fb0b560` by author `Cowork Manual Review <cowork@earnedout.local>` at 2026-05-21T14:41:59Z — a distinct identity from the automated `Ralph Loop <ralph@earnedout.local>`. The loop honestly terminated at iteration 40 (`1166e0e`, 06:46:01Z, `active:false`, promise withheld); `fb0b560` raised `max_iterations` 40→60, which no loop iteration is empowered to do. The evidence file is byte-identical to its committed version (unchanged since `fb0b560`). The file records `op whoami` showing a signed-in account (`bb@braxton.ai`), and a successful non-empty `op read "op://Personal/dealstream.com/username"` with the secret correctly redacted per the SELF-TEST rule. Confirmed `which op` / `op --version` fail in the sandbox — the documented, permanent reason B1 existed; not a defect. Appendix A Stage 3 SELF-TEST (line 188) explicitly directs the loop to confirm the evidence file rather than re-run `op`, so marking Check 2 PASS on operator evidence is exactly what the operator-updated rule mandates. TEST_LOG lines 811–817 contain an explicit, honest HONESTY NOTE acknowledging the loop did not itself run `op` and that the s3 VERIFY phase will subject the evidence to an independent critic. This is honest, not a faked PASS.
>
> **5. IMPROVE — minor attribution looseness, non-blocking.** The evidence file header (line 6) says "Performed by: Biffrey Braxton, directly," but the git committer is `Cowork Manual Review <cowork@earnedout.local>`, not the separate `Biffrey Braxton <bb@braxton.ai>` author identity that exists in the repo (used for commits `b1e41f7`, `478753c`). This is consistent with a manual review session conducted *with* Biffrey through Cowork (the commit message says "manual review 2026-05-21"), so it is not evidence of fabrication — but the two-author distinction means the file's "Biffrey directly" wording slightly overstates verifiable provenance. Suggested fix: the evidence file could note it was committed via the Cowork manual-review session. Does not undermine the PASS.
>
> **6. No BLOCKING findings.** B1 is correctly RESOLVED (BLOCKERS.md:9, 115), F2 is correctly closed (FINDINGS.md:138–149), `open_blockers == 0`. The loop did not re-raise B1 or re-run `op`, per Appendix A Stage 3. TEST_LOG Iteration 41 accurately reflects what is on disk and in git history.
>
> The stage's two SELF-TEST checks were genuinely performed: Check 1 is directly reproducible (I reproduced it) and Check 2 rests on a genuine, provenance-verified operator-evidence file that records a real successful `op read`. Accepting Check 2 on that evidence is exactly what the operator-rewritten Appendix A Stage 3 instructs and is honestly disclosed in the TEST_LOG.

> VERDICT: SHIP

### Loop decision

Verdict: **`SHIP`**, zero BLOCKING findings. Per Step 1.4 ("If verdict is
`SHIP` with no BLOCKING findings: set `status: verified`"), `s3_onepassword` →
`verified`.

The two graded items are non-blocking and do NOT gate verification:
- Finding #1 NIT — cosmetic `✅` emoji in `config/credentials-setup.md`
  (critic: "no fix required").
- Finding #5 IMPROVE — the evidence-file header says "Performed by: Biffrey
  Braxton, directly" while the git committer identity is `Cowork Manual Review`;
  the critic judged this "not evidence of fabrication... consistent with a
  manual review session conducted with Biffrey through Cowork" and "does not
  undermine the PASS."

`unresolved_findings` is NOT incremented: per Step 1.4, the
"write each BLOCKING/IMPROVE finding to `FINDINGS.md`, increment
`unresolved_findings`" instruction is part of the `REVISE`/BLOCKING branch only;
the verdict here is `SHIP` with no BLOCKING finding, so the `verified` branch
applies. This is the same handling applied to the NIT/IMPROVE items in the s1–s8
VERIFY iterations (20–26). The two items are recorded here verbatim for
transparency. `open_blockers` stays 0; B1 not re-raised (RESOLVED).

**`s3_onepassword` → `verified`.** All eight implementable schema/skill/template
stages (s1–s8) are now `verified`; `s9_end_to_end`'s dependency (s1–s8 all
`verified`) is satisfied for the first time. Next iteration: IMPLEMENT on
`s9_end_to_end` (the live end-to-end test run).

---

## Iteration 52 — s9_end_to_end verify

**Phase:** VERIFY. Step 0: `active: true`, `iteration` 51 → 52 (`52 >= 75` false →
no cap termination). Step 1 blocker re-check: `open_blockers == 0`, advisory A1
non-counting; B1 + B2 both RESOLVED. `unresolved_findings == 0` → RESOLVE
skipped. IMPLEMENT: no `not_started` stage with met deps (`s10_schedule` needs
s9 `verified`; s9 is `self_tested`). SELF-TEST: no `implemented` stage. VERIFY:
the s1→s10 scan skipped s1–s8 (`verified`) and landed on the first `self_tested`
stage, `s9_end_to_end`. Spawned an independent general-purpose critic subagent
(Appendix C brief): skeptical fresh context, READ-ONLY; read `REVAMP_PLAN.md`
"Implementation Order" #9 + the full 13-check "Verification" section,
`TEST_LOG.md` iterations 48/49/51, and `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` iterations 48–51.

The critic **independently re-ran Verification Checks 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12**
against the live Airtable base (`appOsvuyy5eK43QTx` / `tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS`) via
the Airtable MCP, and inspected the on-disk artifacts directly:
- **Check 6 (all new fields populated)** — PASS. All 3 `[RALPH TEST]` records
  read live; cvkfxz `recDUV3S985L7ytXK` has Date Added 2026-05-21, Listing ID
  `cvkfxz`, Direct URL, Lead Score 50, Disposition Active, Link Health Live,
  Source Overnight Search; the `Listing Screenshot` field holds a genuine
  Airtable-hosted attachment (`attINtUOSVpZ2s33I`, image/png, 831,574 B,
  1200×3074, thumbnails) — same confirmed for maya0n (`attWVUS63ABhr6F6K`) and
  so8acs (`att4T7fKfwdtz0D1Q`). The iteration-49 honest FAIL → iter-50 RESOLVE
  (F4) → iter-51 re-PASS trail is backed by real data.
- **Check 7 (price-drop)** — PASS. maya0n: Previous Asking Price $1,800,000,
  Asking Price $1,495,000, Date Updated 2026-05-21, Lead Score 35 (re-evaluated),
  Notes carries the `PRICE DROP:` line.
- **Check 8 / 11 / 12** — PASS. so8acs Source = Manual Submission, Disposition
  Passed; maya0n in dashboard Section C not B; all 3 Notes fields carry business
  name + listing ID + direct URL and NO search-results-page URL.
- Filesystem artifacts (7 screenshots, 3 report dirs with `.md`+`.html`+
  `listing-data.json`, dashboard HTML, outreach drafts, run log) all exist and
  are genuine non-stub content.

**Verdict: `SHIP`, zero BLOCKING findings.** Eight numbered items: findings
#1–#5 + #8 are NIT-level PASS confirmations ("no fix needed"); the two IMPROVE
items are non-blocking and plan-sanctioned — #6 (the 3 `[RALPH TEST]` records
remain in the live base; plan Appendix A Stage 9 explicitly permits "delete OR
clearly mark" and they ARE clearly marked in both Business Name and Notes — the
critic suggests deleting them after VERIFY as a cleanliness improvement) and #7
(scope was deliberately narrow — 1 industry / DealStream only — which the plan
explicitly sanctions as "deliberately small scope"; multi-platform extraction
unproven by a live run, flagged for a future broader run). Per Step 1.4 (SHIP +
no BLOCKING → `verified`), `s9_end_to_end` → `verified`; `unresolved_findings`
NOT incremented — the "write each BLOCKING/IMPROVE finding to `FINDINGS.md`"
instruction is part of the `REVISE`/BLOCKING branch only, and the verdict is
`SHIP` with no BLOCKING finding (same handling as the NIT/IMPROVE items in
VERIFY iterations 20–26 and 42). Full critic output recorded above is the
authoritative record. **All 9 implemented stages (s1–s9) are now `verified`;
only `s10_schedule` (`not_started`) remains.** Next iteration: IMPLEMENT on
`s10_schedule` (the nightly scheduled task; see Appendix A Stage 10).

## Iteration 55 — s10_schedule verify

Spawned an independent general-purpose critic subagent (Appendix C brief) to
verify Stage 10. It read `REVAMP_PLAN.md` "Implementation Order" #10,
`TEST_LOG.md` Iteration 54, and inspected the four artifacts directly
(`config/launchd/ai.earnedout.overnight-search.plist`, the installed
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/` copy, `run-overnight-search.sh`, `config/schedule.md`).
It independently re-ran the load-bearing SELF-TEST checks against the real macOS
launchd system. Full critic output:

---

Verification complete. Bash syntax is valid; `claude` resolves at
`/Users/biffreybraxton/.local/bin/claude`, which is the first entry in the
script's exported PATH. (Exit code 1 was only the final `for`-loop test
returning non-zero on the last non-match — not a real failure.)

## Findings — s10_schedule (Stage 10, Nightly schedule)

1. **[PASS] Artifacts all exist and match the plan.** REVAMP_PLAN.md
   Implementation Order #10 calls for "Schedule — Set up via `/schedule` or cron
   for nightly execution." All four artifacts are present and non-empty:
   `config/launchd/ai.earnedout.overnight-search.plist` (1175 B), the installed
   `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` copy, `run-overnight-search.sh` (2328 B, executable
   `-rwxr-xr-x`), and `config/schedule.md` (documented mechanism/cadence/prompt).
   No severity issue.

2. **[PASS] Repo plist and installed plist are byte-identical.** Independent
   `diff` of the two files returned `IDENTICAL` — no version drift between the
   version-controlled source and the installed copy. Matches the TEST_LOG claim.

3. **[PASS — independently re-checked] launchd task is genuinely loaded.**
   `launchctl list | grep -i earnedout` returned
   `-	0	ai.earnedout.overnight-search` (loaded, not running, last exit 0).
   `launchctl print gui/501/ai.earnedout.overnight-search` shows it registered as
   a `LaunchAgent` in `domain = gui/501` with an `event triggers` block:
   `descriptor = { "Minute" => 37, "Hour" => 2 }`,
   `stream = com.apple.launchd.calendarinterval`, `watching = 1`. This confirms
   the intended **02:37 daily** cadence is live in the real macOS launchd system
   — not hand-waving. `runs = 0` (never fired yet — expected, it is not 02:37).

4. **[PASS — independently re-checked] Both plists pass `plutil -lint`.** I ran
   `plutil -lint` on the repo copy and the installed copy; both returned `OK`.

5. **[PASS] Trigger prompt is documented and substantive.**
   `run-overnight-search.sh` line 27 defines `$PROMPT` invoking the
   overnight-search skill end-to-end (op fail-loud credential retrieval,
   Playwright multi-platform search, direct-URL/listing-ID/2024+2025 financials,
   link validation + screenshots, Airtable dedup with price-drop detection on
   `appOsvuyy5eK43QTx`/`tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS`, prospect-evaluation,
   `Source = "Overnight Search"`, outreach drafted to files/Notes only — never
   send, daily dashboard). `config/schedule.md` documents the same. `bash -n`
   confirms valid script syntax.

6. **[NIT] Design choice deviates from the literal plan wording but is
   well-justified.** Plan #10 says "via `/schedule` or cron"; the implementer
   used a macOS `launchd` LaunchAgent instead of a `/schedule` remote routine.
   `config/schedule.md` lines 8-17 explain why: the pipeline needs the `op`
   1Password desktop CLI, which only resolves in the local GUI login session; a
   remote `/schedule` agent has no `op`. launchd is the documented "or cron"
   equivalent. Sound reasoning, no fix needed.

7. **[NIT] `RunAtLoad = false` means the schedule was never smoke-tested by an
   actual fire.** `runs = 0`, `last exit code = (never exited)`. The task is
   correctly loaded but has never executed; a real nightly run depends on the
   runtime prerequisites in `schedule.md` (op signed in, MCP servers configured).
   Suggested optional fix: a one-time
   `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.earnedout.overnight-search` to confirm
   the script chain runs clean. Not blocking for Stage 10, whose scope is
   "schedule exists with the intended cadence and prompt."

**Honesty assessment:** Every PASS in TEST_LOG Iteration 54 is backed by real
evidence. I independently reproduced the three load-bearing checks
(`launchctl list`, `launchctl print` cadence, `plutil -lint`) plus the `diff`
and executable-bit checks, and all outputs match what Iteration 54 reported
exactly — including the `{ "Minute" => 37, "Hour" => 2 }` descriptor and the
byte-identical plists. No fabricated or unsupported PASS found. The stage
produces what the plan intends: a nightly early-morning scheduled task running
the overnight-search skill with a documented trigger prompt.

VERDICT: SHIP

---

**Loop disposition:** `VERDICT: SHIP` with zero BLOCKING findings (the two graded
items are NITs — #6 the well-justified `launchd`-vs-`/schedule` choice, #7
`RunAtLoad=false`/never-fired which is out of Stage 10's scope). Per Step 1.4
(SHIP + no BLOCKING → `verified`), `s10_schedule` → `verified`.
`unresolved_findings` NOT incremented (the write-findings instruction applies
only on the REVISE/BLOCKING branch, and only to BLOCKING/IMPROVE severities —
NITs do not qualify). **All 10 stages (s1–s10) are now `verified`.** Next
iteration: FINAL AUDIT (Step 1 phase 5).

## Iteration 56 — FINAL AUDIT

Spawned the comprehensive final-audit subagent (Appendix C final-audit variant):
skeptical fresh context, read `REVAMP_PLAN.md` in full, independently confirmed
the 10 Implementation Order items and 13 Verification checks against the actual
files, the live Airtable schema + the 3 s9 records, the dashboard, the launchd
task, and the `_ralph/` logs. Full auditor output below.

---

# Final Audit — EarnedOut Overnight-Search Revamp

## Implementation Order (10 items)

1. **Repo setup** — SATISFIED. All 10 dirs present/non-empty.
2. **Playwright MCP** — SATISFIED. `.claude/settings.json` carries the server;
   browser-driven s9 screenshots exist.
3. **1Password integration** — PARTIALLY SATISFIED. `config/credentials-setup.md`
   documents the correct `op://Personal/dealstream.com/...` path, install,
   fail-loud; `op` 2.33.1 installed; operator evidence file genuine. BUT see
   Finding 1 — the skills themselves use the wrong path.
4. **Airtable fields** — SATISFIED. Independently confirmed all 16 fields via
   `get_table_schema`: correct types; option sets exact (Disposition 6, Link
   Health 3, Source 2). Financial fields `Revenue/Cash Flow 2024/2025` per F3.
5. **Rewrite overnight-search skill.md** — DEFECTIVE (Finding 1).
6. **Create submit-url skill** — DEFECTIVE (Finding 1).
7. **Update outreach templates** — SATISFIED.
8. **Daily dashboard template** — SATISFIED.
9. **Test run** — SATISFIED (with caveat). Live s9 run produced 3 real Airtable
   records, 7 screenshots, 3 report dirs, dashboard.
10. **Schedule** — SATISFIED. `launchctl list` shows `ai.earnedout.overnight-search`
    loaded; plist valid; cadence `Hour=2 Minute=37` confirmed.

## Verification (13 checks)

Checks 1–13 backed by genuine evidence; auditor independently re-read the 3
Airtable records — Check 6 (genuine `image/png` screenshot attachments), Check 7
(maya0n price-drop $1.8M→$1.495M), Check 8 (so8acs Source=Manual Submission),
Check 11 (maya0n Disposition=Revisit for Roll-up), Check 12 (Notes clean) — all
genuinely PASS. No faked PASS found in TEST_LOG for the 13 checks.

## Findings

1. **[BLOCKING]** Both executable skills retrieve credentials with the wrong,
   proven-non-resolving 1Password path. `overnight-search/skill.md:26-27` and
   `submit-url/skill.md:14` use `op://Private/DealStream/...`. The operator
   evidence (`_ralph/evidence/s3_op_verification_2026-05-21.md`) proves that path
   FAILS (`"Private" isn't a vault`). Canonical path `op://Personal/dealstream.com/...`
   is in REVAMP_PLAN.md, credentials-setup.md, run-overnight-search.sh — but NOT
   the two skills. overnight-search/skill.md:23 mislabels the wrong path
   "canonical". Run as written, the skill's fail-loud rule halts the pipeline.
2. **[NIT]** `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md:22` also carries the stale path.
3. **[NIT]** `_ralph/STATE.md` uncommitted — the loop's own in-progress state.
4. **[IMPROVE]** The 3 `[RALPH TEST]` records remain live in the production
   Airtable base. Marked (Stage 9 permits "delete or clearly mark"), but they
   appear in the dashboard running queue. Recommend deleting.

VERDICT: REVISE

---

**Loop disposition (Step 1 phase 5, REVISE branch):** Wrote **F5** (BLOCKING,
s5+s6) and **F6** (IMPROVE, s9) to `FINDINGS.md`; `unresolved_findings` 0 → 2.
Demoted the two stages Finding 1 flags: `s5_overnight_skill` `verified` →
`self_tested`, `s6_submit_url` `verified` → `self_tested`. `s9_end_to_end` stays
`verified` (F6 is an enhancement — records ARE clearly marked, satisfying Stage
9's literal SELF-TEST bar). `final_audit_passed` stays `false`. The BLOCKING
finding is genuine and is precisely the failure mode this loop exists to catch:
a pre-correction credential path frozen into the skills before the 2026-05-21
operator correction, never re-grepped by the s5/s6 SELF-TEST/VERIFY phases. Next
iteration: RESOLVE F5.
