# Off-Market Build Loop — Verify Log

One entry per VERIFY phase (per-stage critic subagent) and for the FINAL AUDIT
(independent auditor subagent): date, iteration, stage, verdict, and findings
classified `BLOCKING` / `IMPROVE` / `NIT`.

## iter 3 — 2026-05-22 — s1 (Foundations & config) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent inspected the actual s1 deliverables on disk
(`.claude/skills/off-market-search/skill.md`, `config/offmarket_sources.md`)
and cross-checked codes/endpoints against the §13 resolution doc. Not given the
loop's logs or reasoning.

**Verdict: PASS (0 BLOCKING).**

All four Done-when criteria met:
- C1 — skill scaffold + `skill.md` with valid `name`/`description` frontmatter
  and the §9.1 nine-step outline in the exact specified order. PASS.
- C2 — `config/offmarket_sources.md` lists all 11 sources (S1–S11) each with a
  verified access method, endpoint, rate-limit/ToS. PASS.
- C3 — no `⚠ VERIFY:` placeholders remain (the single grep hit is the
  self-referential negation sentence at config line 7). PASS.
- C4 — verified codes correct: NAICS 541930 (CONFIRMED, includes sign
  language), PSC R608 (CONFIRMED, low-confidence flag cleared), GSA MAS SIN
  541930 — all consistent with the §13 resolution doc. PASS.

Hard constraints honored: SKELETON marking present; source layer documented
swappable; FPDS-NG explicitly excluded with SAM.gov Contract Awards API named
as successor and USAspending.gov as primary; Class-1/Class-2 keyword lists +
B2 default present; entity-identifier priority order documented; no fabricated
codes/endpoints.

Findings (non-blocking, filed in `FINDINGS.md`):
- F1 IMPROVE — `offmarket_sources.md` lines 10–12 use a non-standard `/ … /`
  comment delimiter that renders literally in Markdown.
- F2 NIT — config line 7's literal `⚠ VERIFY:` string inside a negation
  sentence could trip a future automated placeholder scan.

Stage s1 → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` → 2.

## iter 7 — 2026-05-22 — s3 (Source adapters) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the actual s3 artifacts
on disk — `.claude/skills/off-market-search/references/source_adapters.md`,
`skill.md` Step 2, `config/offmarket_sources.md`, and the four
`evidence/s3-fixtures/*.json` recordings — against the s3 `Done-when` criteria
and the build-plan constraints. Not given the loop's logs or reasoning.

**Verdict: PASS (0 BLOCKING).**

All three Done-when criteria met:
- Common interface — `source_adapters.md` §1 defines a single
  `adapter.query(target_class, params)` contract returning
  `{records:[RawRecord], meta:AdapterMeta}`; `RawRecord` (23 fields) and
  `AdapterMeta` (6 fields) are concretely specified. PASS.
- All named sources covered behind that interface — 11 adapters S1–S11; the §3
  registry table makes swap a one-line change. PASS.
- Each adapter returns normalized records from a live or recorded-fixture
  query — S1/S4 live recordings, S2/S3 structural fixtures (honestly labeled,
  placeholder UEIs, write-guard documented), all map cleanly to `RawRecord`.
  PASS.
- Rate limits / ToS documented per source S1–S11. PASS.

Hard constraints honored: no `fpds.gov` (SAM Contract Awards API used instead);
RID no-bulk-copy enforced in code (`status: n/a` without a name); SBA
prior-approval government fact on every Class-2 record (confirmed in the S4
fixture mapping); blocked adapters S2/S3 (B3) and S8 (B1) degrade gracefully —
not faked PASSes; unknown fields → `null`, never fabricated.

Findings (non-blocking, filed in `FINDINGS.md`):
- NIT-s3-1 — `source_adapters.md:174` cites CSV column `"Managed by"`; the live
  SBIC CSV header is `Manager`.
- IMPROVE-s3-1 — S1 `uei` (primary s4 resolution key) is not returned by
  `spending_by_award`; the adapter needs a recipient-detail follow-up call.

Stage s3 → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` → 4.

## iter 10 — 2026-05-22 — s4 (Entity resolution & de-duplication) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the actual s4 artifacts on
disk — `.claude/skills/off-market-search/references/entity_resolution.md`,
`skill.md` Step 3/4, `references/source_adapters.md`, `evidence/s4-selftest.md`,
the `evidence/s3-fixtures/*.json` recordings — and independently sanity-checked
the live `tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS` schema via the Airtable MCP (read-only). Not given
the loop's logs or reasoning.

**Verdict: PASS (0 BLOCKING).**

All three Done-when criteria met:
- C1 — distinct gov records collapse to one candidate. The §6.1 UEI→CAGE→DUNS→
  name+address ladder is fully specified; S2/S3 fixtures genuinely both carry
  `uei ZZTEST00FIX1` and merge to one `CanonicalEntity` (2→1, real not faked).
  PASS.
- C2 — an `existing` candidate is updated, not duplicated. §3 defines all three
  dedup keys (A gov-id / B name+address / C SBIC license), the `existing`
  verdict, `tracker_record_id`, and the fill-blanks update path; the self-test
  exercises each key. PASS.
- C3 — resolution accuracy spot-checked toward ≥95%. §6 mandates the check;
  self-test records 4/4 correct (100%), 0% duplicate rate, and honestly defers a
  larger live sample to s10. PASS.

Honesty/constraints honored: seeded `existing` rows SR-A/B/C are explicitly
in-memory only — no production write occurred (critic confirmed 0/167 live rows
carry `Gov Entity ID`/`SBIC License #`); S1 thin records route to
`needs_operator_review`, not fabricated; fail-loud on tracker-read failure;
DUNS as legacy bridge only; same base/table — no parallel tracker; `RawRecord`
field names match `source_adapters.md` exactly.

Findings (non-blocking, filed in `FINDINGS.md`):
- IMPROVE-s4-1 — `entity_resolution.md:36` `dedup_verdict` enum omits the
  `needs_operator_review` state used in §4.
- IMPROVE-s4-2 — `entity_resolution.md:89/101` DUNS step is a non-obvious
  exception to "first match wins"; state it explicitly.
- IMPROVE-s4-3 — `evidence/s4-selftest.md:28-29` asserts R1's merged
  `naics`/`psc`/`award_total` without showing the per-field union trace.
- IMPROVE-s4-4 — `evidence/s4-selftest.md:42-43` until IMPROVE-s3-1 closes,
  every S1 record routes to `needs_operator_review`, so the accuracy spot-check
  never exercises real S1 data; gate s10's larger sample on IMPROVE-s3-1.
- NIT-s4-1 — `entity_resolution.md:206` example `entity_id` `SBIC:09/79-0292`
  embeds a slash; harmless in a text field but mildly fragile.

Stage s4 → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` → 9.

## iter 13 — 2026-05-22 — s5 (Enrichment & qualification pre-filters) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the actual s5 artifacts on
disk — `.claude/skills/off-market-search/references/enrichment.md`, `skill.md`
enrichment/pre-filter steps, `references/airtable_schema_preflight.md`,
`config/offmarket_sources.md`, `references/source_adapters.md`,
`references/entity_resolution.md`, `evidence/s5-selftest.md` — and cross-checked
the §3/§7/§11 PRD requirements and the §13 resolution doc. Not given the loop's
logs or reasoning. The critic also cross-checked the live `Gov Data Source`
choice set against `evidence/s2-airtable-schema.md`.

**Verdict: FAIL (1 BLOCKING).**

The s5 spec is largely sound — the §7.4 pre-filters are specified to run before
enrichment, the SBIC good-standing cross-check goes beyond the directory, the
"never fabricate" rule is honored, no new scorer is introduced, and the
SBA-prior-approval change-of-control fact is carried on every Class-2 packet
(`enrichment.md:187-189`). One Done-when / hard-constraint violation blocks it:

- **BLOCKING-s5-1** — `LeadPacket.gov_data_source` points at a non-existent
  mapping table and the self-test emits an **invalid Airtable choice**.
  `enrichment.md:64` and `:231` say `source_ids` are "mapped to the
  `Gov Data Source` Airtable choice (per `airtable_schema_preflight.md`)", but
  that file contains no `source_id → choice` mapping table. `s5-selftest.md:97`
  then emits `["SAM.gov Entity Management", "SAM.gov Contract Awards"]` — but
  `"SAM.gov Entity Management"` is not one of the eight live `Gov Data Source`
  choices (`evidence/s2-airtable-schema.md:15`: USAspending / SAM.gov / SAM.gov
  Contract Awards / SBA SBIC / SBS / GSA eLibrary / State / RID). The correct S2
  value is `SAM.gov`. Because multi-select choices auto-grow on write
  (`s2-airtable-schema.md:23`), writing the wrong string would silently create a
  spurious 9th choice — violating the "fail loud, never silently create"
  invariant and breaking field-value consistency with the s7 Airtable write.

Findings filed in `FINDINGS.md`: BLOCKING-s5-1 (above), IMPROVE-s5-1 (screenshot
path not filesystem-safe for `entity_id`s containing `:`/`|`/spaces),
IMPROVE-s5-2 (Class-2 pre-filter §2.2 condition 2 is a no-op on a first run —
state that plainly), IMPROVE-s5-3 (good-standing cross-check demonstrated for
only one Class-2 entity — s10 must repeat across all), NIT-s5-1
(`s4-selftest.md:29` provenance note cites the wrong source record), NIT-s5-2
(`enrichment.md:53` `employee_count` typed `number | string`, inconsistent with
the `... | null` unknown-able fields).

Stage s5 → `not_started` (BLOCKING → return to IMPLEMENT). `unresolved_findings`
→ 15.

## iter 16 — 2026-05-22 — s5 (Enrichment & qualification pre-filters) — VERIFY (re-run)

Fresh-context critic subagent independently re-inspected the actual s5 artifacts
on disk after the iter-14 re-IMPLEMENT and iter-15 re-SELF-TEST —
`.claude/skills/off-market-search/references/enrichment.md`, `skill.md`,
`references/airtable_schema_preflight.md`, `references/source_adapters.md`,
`references/entity_resolution.md`, `evidence/s5-selftest.md`,
`evidence/s2-airtable-schema.md`, `config/offmarket_sources.md` — cross-checked
the §3/§7/§11 PRD + §13 resolution doc, and independently queried the **live
Airtable `Gov Data Source` field** (`fldM7KoR2gtfvBVWN`) to confirm its eight
choices. Not given the loop's logs or reasoning. Tasked specifically with
disproving that BLOCKING-s5-1 is resolved.

**Verdict: PASS (0 BLOCKING).**

BLOCKING-s5-1 confirmed genuinely fixed:
- `enrichment.md` §5.1 (lines 240-264) is a real `source_id → Gov Data Source`
  mapping table; every right-hand value is a member of the live eight-choice set
  (critic queried the live field: USAspending / SAM.gov / SAM.gov Contract
  Awards / SBA SBIC / SBS / GSA eLibrary / State / RID). S10/S11 correctly
  excluded as enrichment-only.
- The fail-loud rule (`enrichment.md:266-273`) concretely halts the skill on an
  unmapped `source_id` with a schema-preflight-style operator message; the
  multi-select is never auto-grown. Exercised by self-test C7 step 5 (`S99`).
- The iter-13 offender `"SAM.gov Entity Management"` now appears only as an
  adapter-name *description* (mapping S2 → choice `SAM.gov`) and in an explicit
  negative in the self-test — never as an emitted `gov_data_source` value.

All three Done-when criteria met: complete lead packet (C4/C5, zero
fabrication); pre-filters run first and drop non-fits before any enrichment
(C2); SBIC standing cross-referenced beyond the directory via SBA OIG / press
releases / federal court records / IAPD, no directory flag (C6). Hard
constraints honored: never fabricate, fail loud, no new scorer, no parallel
tracker, SBA prior-approval change-of-control fact on every Class-2 packet.

Findings (non-blocking, filed in `FINDINGS.md`):
- IMPROVE-s5-4 (new) — `s5-selftest.md:174`/`:177` C7 cites stale line numbers
  (97/125) for the `gov_data_source` rows; after the iter-15 rewrite they are at
  lines 104/132.
- IMPROVE-s5-1, IMPROVE-s5-2, NIT-s5-2 — carried open from iter 13 (still valid).

Stage s5 → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` → 15.

## iter 19 — 2026-05-22 — s6 (Scoring integration) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the actual s6 artifacts on
disk — `.claude/skills/off-market-search/references/scoring_integration.md`,
`skill.md` Step 5, `evidence/s6-selftest.md`, the two captured report
directories `output/reports/uei-zztest00fix1/` and
`output/reports/name-1st-source-capital-south-bend-in/` (opened the `.md` + `.html`
reports, checked header/scorecard/breakdown score consistency) — and independently
confirmed via `git status` / `git log` that `.claude/skills/prospect-evaluation/`
is unmodified by the build. Not given the loop's logs or reasoning.

**Verdict: PASS (0 BLOCKING).**

Both Done-when criteria met:
- DW1 — a Class-1 and a Class-2 candidate each produce a score + report via the
  UNMODIFIED `prospect-evaluation` skill. PASS. R1 → 30/110 (header line 29,
  scorecard field 26, breakdown total line 85 — all agree), `.md`+`.html` on
  disk under `output/reports/uei-zztest00fix1/`. R2 → 30/100 informational
  (header line 37, scorecard line 85, breakdown line 104), `.md`+`.html` on
  disk. `prospect-evaluation/` git-clean, no build-era commits — used verbatim.
- DW2 — "no asking price" handled as "insufficient data — not awarded", not a
  failure. PASS. Buy Box line 5 → ⚠️ (not ❌); valuation rubric line →
  `0 / "insufficient data — not awarded"`; neither run crashed/aborted/dropped
  the candidate.

Hard constraints honored: no new scorer (mode selection driven by target class —
`scoring_integration.md` §2 maps class 1→`rollup_addon` /110 no size floor,
class 2→`sbic` good-standing gate informational); no fabrication (every
undisclosed field "insufficient data", `$480K` award total not converted to
EBITDA, R2 contact carried verbatim from the s5 lead packet); SBA prior-approval
change-of-control fact carried on the Class-2 report (dedicated section, Risk
Factors, 13 CFR Part 107); `report_slug` filesystem-safe and deterministic.

Findings (non-blocking, filed in `FINDINGS.md`):
- IMPROVE-s6-1 — `scoring_integration.md:20` / `skill.md:43` / build-plan:229
  cite `prospect-evaluation/references/buy-box-and-scoring.md`, which does not
  exist; the rubric lives inside `prospect-evaluation/skill.md`.
- IMPROVE-s6-2 — both scored candidates are build-loop test inputs (R1 a
  synthetic fixture); a genuine real-company Class-1 score is deferred to s10.
- NIT-s6-1 — `s6-selftest.md:18` cites a stale R1 score line (70, actually 85).
- NIT-s6-2 — `prospect-evaluation/skill.md` has owner-only file mode (cosmetic,
  pre-existing).

Stage s6 → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` → 19.

## iter 24 — 2026-05-22 — s8 (Outreach drafting) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the s8 deliverables on
disk — `config/offmarket_outreach_template.md`, `references/outreach_drafting.md`,
the broker `config/outreach_templates.md`, and the two s8 evidence files — plus
git history. Not given the loop's logs or reasoning. Tasked to disprove that s8
is done.

**Verdict: PASS (0 BLOCKING).**

Done-when criteria, all MET:
- DW1 — a draft is generated for a candidate with a direct contact. PASS. Two
  drafts in `s8-offmarket_outreach_drafts_2026-05-22.md`: a Class-1 OM-1 draft
  (EXAMPLE INTERPRETING FIXTURE LLC, partial contact — name, no email) and a
  Class-2 OM-2 draft (1st Source Capital Corporation, full contact). No raw
  `[...]` placeholder survives in either block. The no-contact case (SYN-NC1)
  correctly yields no draft and fabricates no contact.
- DW2 — nothing is auto-sent. PASS. Independent grep across both s8 deliverables
  for `send|gmail|smtp|mailto|transport|sendmail` — every hit is a prohibition
  or the literal NOT-SENT marker. No send code path. Both stored drafts carry
  the `--- OFF-MARKET OUTREACH DRAFT (NOT SENT) ---` / `--- END DRAFT (review
  and send manually) ---` markers.
- DW3 — broker templates untouched. PASS. `git log --all -- config/
  outreach_templates.md` shows last touch at `323a782` (on-market revamp loop) —
  no `offmarket-build` commit modifies it; working tree clean. s8 added a new
  sibling file, `config/offmarket_outreach_template.md`.

Invariants honored: no fabrication (no-contact → skip, partial contact → missing
email surfaced as `needs follow-up`); SBA prior-approval change-of-control
sentence is fixed body text in OM-2 and appears verbatim in the Class-2 draft;
the off-market template is dedicated and distinct from the broker templates
(addresses owner / SBIC GP principal, business not for sale, no NDA/CIM
language).

Findings (non-blocking, filed in `FINDINGS.md`):
- IMPROVE-s8-1 — OM-2 body addresses the recipient "as a principal" but the
  contact gate accepts any direct contact; R2's only enriched contact was titled
  "Investor Relations". Prefer a principal-titled contact or soften the body.
- NIT-s8-1 — stray trailing `</content>` / `</invoke>` tokens leaked into the
  two s8 evidence files.

Stage s8 → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` 19 → 21.

## iter 27 — 2026-05-22 — s9 (Orchestration & cadence) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the actual s9 artifacts on
disk — `.claude/skills/off-market-search/skill.md`,
`references/orchestration.md`, the seven other stage reference files,
`run-offmarket-search.sh`, `config/offmarket_schedule.md`,
`config/launchd/ai.earnedout.offmarket-search.plist`, and
`evidence/s9-offmarket_run_log_dryrun.md` — ran `bash -n` and `plutil -lint`
itself, and independently checked live cron state (`CronList`, `launchctl`,
`~/Library/LaunchAgents`). Not given the loop's logs or reasoning. Tasked to
disprove that s9 is done.

**Verdict: PASS (0 BLOCKING).**

All three Done-when criteria met:
- DW1 — full pipeline wired end-to-end. `skill.md` Steps 1–9 in fixed order;
  the `orchestration.md` §1 hand-off table chains type-consistently at every
  boundary, confirmed against the actual `source_adapters.md` /
  `entity_resolution.md` / `enrichment.md` / `scoring_integration.md` /
  `airtable_write.md` types, not the table's own claims. PASS.
- DW2 — manual single-entity path specified end-to-end (`orchestration.md` §4,
  `skill.md:193-205`): input forms, Step-2 skip with direct resolution seeding,
  Steps 3–9 unchanged, dated-section run-log append, operator report. Mirrors
  `submit-url`. PASS.
- DW3 — weekly cadence defined and version-controlled: `config/
  offmarket_schedule.md`, `run-offmarket-search.sh` (`bash -n` clean,
  executable), plist (`plutil -lint` OK, `Weekday=1 Hour=6` = Monday 06:00).
  Live `/schedule` registration honestly gated on B4 and documented as the
  post-B4 install step — correct per the build-loop rule (a blocked precondition
  does not block a stage whose own deliverable is complete). PASS.

Hard constraints honored: no parallel tracker / no new scorer (only
`appOsvuyy5eK43QTx`/`tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS` and `prospect-evaluation`); fail-loud
halts (Step 1 preflight, Step 3 tracker read); no fabrication, no auto-send
(grep for `send/smtp/gmail/mailto` finds only prohibitions); degraded run still
completes + logs; s9 adds no new pipeline logic — glue only, all seven s2–s8
references present on disk.

Findings (non-blocking, filed in `FINDINGS.md`):
- NIT-s9-1 — `orchestration.md:26` §1 table tags Step 3 output
  `new / existing / needs_operator_review`, but `entity_resolution.md:61` types
  `dedup_verdict` as only `new | existing`; cosmetic, does not break the
  hand-off.
- NIT-s9-2 — `evidence/s9-offmarket_run_log_dryrun.md` "Sources queried" table
  omits the enrichment-only sources S5/S6/S7; a live run should list every
  source attempted.

Stage s9 → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` 21 → 23.

## iter 30 — 2026-05-22 — s10 (Assembly, end-to-end dry run) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the actual s10 artifacts
on disk — `evidence/s10-e2e-dryrun.md`, `evidence/s10-offmarket_run_log_e2e_dryrun.md`,
and both scored report sets under `output/reports/uei-zztest00fix1/` and
`output/reports/name-1st-source-capital-south-bend-in/` (`.md`, `.html`,
`lead-packet.json`) — and read a live `get_table_schema` of `tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS`.
Not given the loop's logs or reasoning. Scope: the s10 dry-run Done-when only
("the dry run produces ≥1 scored record per class into a test context with no
fabricated fields") — the final-audit / all-stages-`verified` halves are the
separate FINAL AUDIT phase, gated on s2/s7 (B4).

**Verdict: FAIL (1 BLOCKING).**

The critic read the report **bodies** field-by-field — which the s10 SELF-TEST
C3 check did not — and found the Class-2 report fabricates a scoring-
determinative field relative to its own declared input packet:

- **BLOCKING-s10-1** — `1st-source-capital-corporation-report.md` (lines 28, 62,
  97, 127, 131, and `.html`) returns Buy Box line 3 `✅ PASS` and awards
  **10/10** for "Years in business ≥10" — 10 of R2's 30 points — citing an
  incorporated-1983 formation date, street address, SEC CIK, and CB Insights
  data that are **absent** from `lead-packet.json` (which sets `formation_date`
  / `years_in_business` to `null` and lists "formation date" in
  `enrichment_gaps`). Per `scoring_integration.md:91-92,99` a gap must be passed
  through as missing and scored "insufficient data — not awarded" (as the R1
  report correctly does). The report back-filled it instead — fabrication
  relative to the packet, inflating the verifiable score; packet and report now
  contradict each other on disk. Honest R2 score is 20/100, not 30.

Checks that PASSED: Class-1 fixture R1 is acceptable — synthetic nature loudly
disclosed (`_fixture_note`, report banner, `s10-e2e-dryrun.md:140` limitation 4),
build plan permits a fixture sample, and the R1 report fabricates nothing; both
`lead-packet.json` files are clean (every unknown `null`/"needs follow-up",
enumerated in `enrichment_gaps`); writes 0 created / 0 updated, live schema
confirms B4 still open and honestly disclosed; 2 drafts both carry NOT-SENT
markers, nothing auto-sent; run-log count trace internally consistent; B1/B3/B4
and R1's fixture nature all disclosed. No parallel tracker, no new scorer.

Non-blocking findings filed in `FINDINGS.md`: IMPROVE-s10-1 (run log cites a
production path for a dry-run-only file), IMPROVE-s10-2 (Class-2 scored count
omits carried-but-unscored R3/R4), NIT-s10-1 (reused fixture artifacts carry
stale stage-provenance labels). The critic's stray-`</content>` flag is the
already-tracked NIT-s8-1 — not double-counted.

Per the phase ladder, a BLOCKING finding returns the stage to `not_started`.
Stage s10 → `not_started`. `unresolved_findings` 23 → 27 (BLOCKING-s10-1 +
3 non-blocking). Next phase for s10: IMPLEMENT — re-score R2 strictly from its
packet and reconcile the report with `lead-packet.json` per BLOCKING-s10-1.

## iter 34 — 2026-05-22 — s2 (Airtable schema) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the actual s2 artifacts —
the **live** Airtable schema of base `appOsvuyy5eK43QTx` / table
`tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS` (via the Airtable MCP `list_tables_for_base` +
`get_table_schema`) and the preflight reference file
`.claude/skills/off-market-search/references/airtable_schema_preflight.md`.
Not given the loop's logs or reasoning. Tasked to disprove that s2 is done.

**Verdict: PASS (0 BLOCKING).**

Both Done-when criteria met:
- DW1 — all six required fields exist live with the exact name + type:
  `Gov Entity ID` (`fld7Ook8ZoLAjwFTe`, singleLineText), `SBIC License #`
  (`fldogicjVNMCBuyJI`, singleLineText), `SBIC License Status`
  (`fldscFvXPUFYbSg3F`, singleSelect), `Gov Data Source` (`fldM7KoR2gtfvBVWN`,
  multipleSelects), `Federal Award History $` (`fldZXrqqoBkIdDWJN`, currency),
  `Source` (`fldiGyXTk6Ybb6J1L`, singleSelect). All six field IDs cited in the
  preflight match the live schema. The `Source` single-select carries both
  off-market values — `Off-Market — ASL Bolt-on` (`selezt48WJR6jPv2m`) and
  `Off-Market — SBIC` (`seltqCid0e9t6aijI`) — confirmed byte-for-byte (em dash
  U+2014 = `e2 80 94`, single ASCII spaces) by hexdump against the plan and the
  preflight file. `SBIC License Status` carries all five options
  (Good Standing / Under Review / Surrendered / Revoked / Unknown). PASS.
- DW2 — the preflight check is genuinely fail-loud: it checks all six fields by
  name+type, both `Source` options (explicit U+2014 requirement), all five
  `SBIC License Status` options, and on any miss HALTS with a named-missing
  operator message and explicitly never auto-creates. PASS.

Hard constraints honored: no parallel tracker (preflight targets the correct
base/table); fail loud, never silent (no auto-create path).

Findings: none BLOCKING, none IMPROVE. One NIT raised by the critic — whether
the skill body invokes the preflight as "Step 1" — is explicitly outside s2
scope and was already confirmed by the iter-27 s9 VERIFY ("fail-loud halts
(Step 1 preflight ...)"). Not filed as a new finding.

Stage s2 → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` unchanged at 27.

## iter 39 — 2026-05-22 — s7 (Airtable write & dashboard badge) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the actual s7 artifacts —
`.claude/skills/off-market-search/references/airtable_write.md`,
`.claude/skills/off-market-search/references/airtable_schema_preflight.md`,
`templates/daily-dashboard.html`, and the **live** Airtable row in base
`appOsvuyy5eK43QTx` / table `tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS` (via the Airtable MCP
`get_table_schema` + `list_records_for_table`). Not given the loop's logs or
reasoning. Tasked to disprove that s7 is done.

**Verdict: PASS (0 BLOCKING).**

All three Done-when criteria met:
- DW1 — a scored off-market prospect is a live, normal `Active` row.
  Record `recklDY7vHFmKauQD` confirmed live (`createdTime
  2026-05-22T17:01:52Z`): `Source = "Off-Market — SBIC"` (`seltqCid0e9t6aijI`,
  correct em dash/spacing), `Disposition = "Active"` (`selKN12meneKypCem`),
  `Lead Score = 20`, `Industry Match = "SBIC"`, `Gov Entity ID`,
  `SBIC License Status = "Good Standing"`, `Gov Data Source = ["SBA SBIC"]`.
  `Lead Source` blank (no gov string into the 14-option broker singleSelect →
  no 422). The five §8.4 fields exist live with correct types. No fabricated
  value — unknowns (`SBIC License #`, `Federal Award History $`, gov-record
  URL) left blank / recorded "needs follow-up" in `Notes`. PASS.
- DW2 — the off-market badge renders on off-market rows only. `.chip.offmarket`
  style block at `daily-dashboard.html:154-158`; render condition
  `{% if lead.source.startswith('Off-Market') %}` in all three row sections
  (New Finds 242, Running Queue 288, Revisit Bucket 330); additive — on-market
  rows and existing chips untouched; no `Source` column added. PASS.
- DW3 — field-by-field mapping per PRD §8. `airtable_write.md` §3 maps every
  field with IDs matching the live schema; §3.1 leaves `Lead Source` blank with
  rationale; §6 forbids auto-creating any select option and names the iter-36
  HTTP 422 failure mode; §2 / `airtable_schema_preflight.md` specify the
  fail-loud preflight. PASS.

Hard constraints honored: no parallel tracker, fail-loud preflight, no
fabrication, no auto-created select option, `Lead Source` blank.

Findings: none BLOCKING. The critic raised two NIT-level items it explicitly
assessed as "no action needed" / "not a defect" (the `Lead Source` option list
is consistent; the `Notes` score-line wording is a reasonable template
expansion) — not filed. One IMPROVE-level note — the R2 row's gov-record URL
is genuinely unresolved — is already honestly marked "needs follow-up" in
`Notes`; it is an operator data follow-up on the test record, not a build
defect, and there is nothing in the codebase to fix, so it is not filed as an
open finding.

Stage s7 → `verified`. `unresolved_findings` unchanged at 27; `open_blockers` 0.

## iter 41 — 2026-05-22 — s10 (Assembly, end-to-end self-test) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the actual s10 dry-run
artifacts — `evidence/s10-e2e-dryrun.md`,
`evidence/s10-offmarket_run_log_e2e_dryrun.md`, the Class-1 scored record
`output/reports/uei-zztest00fix1/` and the Class-2 scored record
`output/reports/name-1st-source-capital-south-bend-in/` (each `lead-packet.json`
+ `.md` + `.html`) — plus the s10 outreach deliverable
`evidence/s8-offmarket_outreach_drafts_2026-05-22.md`. Not given the loop's logs
or reasoning. Tasked to disprove the s10 dry-run `Done-when` ("the dry run
produces at least one scored record per class into a test context with no
fabricated fields"). The final-audit / all-stages-`verified` halves are the
FINAL AUDIT phase and were explicitly out of scope.

**Verdict: FAIL (1 BLOCKING).**

Five of the six concrete criteria PASS:
- Dry run exists and is documented (both write-ups present and detailed).
- ≥1 scored record per class: Class-1 R1 30/110, Class-2 R2 20/100 — each with
  `.md`, `.html`, `lead-packet.json` on disk.
- R1 report traces field-by-field to its packet; R2 report bodies also trace
  clean — **BLOCKING-s10-1 is genuinely fixed** in both R2 `.md` and `.html`
  (Buy Box line 3 + years-in-business line both 0/10 "insufficient data — not
  awarded"; 1983 labeled informational fund-level data only; header 20/100 =
  breakdown total).
- Test context, not the live tracker: run log shows 0 created / 0 updated / 0
  failures by the dry run.
- Nothing auto-sent: both drafts carry the NOT-SENT markers; the no-contact
  candidate was correctly skipped.
- Run log assembled from real prior-stage counts (8 raw → 7 canonical → 4
  pre-filter passes → 2 scored → 2 drafts + 1 skip), matching the step trace.

**BLOCKING finding — BLOCKING-s10-2.** The R2 OM-2 outreach draft
(`evidence/s8-offmarket_outreach_drafts_2026-05-22.md` lines 85-86) asserts
"1st Source Capital Corporation has operated as a licensed SBIC ... **since
1983** — a long, durable track record in the program." The R2 lead packet has
`formation_date: null`, `years_in_business: null`, and an enrichment gap
`"formation date — needs follow-up (B1)"`; the `1983` is
`sbic_gp_economics.vintage` (the SBIC **fund's** vintage), not a company
operating-start date. This is the BLOCKING-s10-1 fabrication defect class
recurring in the s10 dry run's outreach deliverable — the dry run therefore does
not yet produce its records "with no fabricated fields". Verified directly
against the file and the packet before recording. Logged as **BLOCKING-s10-2**
in `FINDINGS.md`.

The critic also raised one IMPROVE (the drafts file header still labels itself
an s8-only artifact though the s10 dry run depends on it) — logged as
**IMPROVE-s10-4** — and one NIT (a stray `</content>` token at line 106), which
is already tracked as **NIT-s8-1** and is not double-counted.

Per the phase contract a BLOCKING finding returns the stage to `not_started`.
Stage s10 → `not_started`. `unresolved_findings` 28 → 30 (BLOCKING-s10-2 +
IMPROVE-s10-4). `open_blockers` 0. Next phase for s10: IMPLEMENT — rewrite the
OM-2 draft to drop the "since 1983" claim and harden the draft-generation logic
so a fund `vintage` cannot be rendered as a company operating history.

## iter 44 — 2026-05-22 — s10 (Assembly, end-to-end self-test) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the actual s10 dry-run
artifacts — `evidence/s10-e2e-dryrun.md`,
`evidence/s10-offmarket_run_log_e2e_dryrun.md`, the Class-1 scored record
`output/reports/uei-zztest00fix1/` and the Class-2 scored record
`output/reports/name-1st-source-capital-south-bend-in/` (each `lead-packet.json`
+ `.md` + `.html`) — plus the s10 outreach deliverable
`evidence/s8-offmarket_outreach_drafts_2026-05-22.md`. Not given the loop's logs
or reasoning. Tasked to disprove the s10 dry-run `Done-when` ("the dry run
produces at least one scored record per class into a test context with no
fabricated fields"); the final-audit / all-stages-`verified` halves are the
separate FINAL AUDIT phase and were explicitly out of scope.

**Verdict: PASS (0 BLOCKING).**

All in-scope criteria PASS:
- **≥1 scored record per class.** Class-1 R1 `output/reports/uei-zztest00fix1/`
  30/110 (rollup_addon mode); Class-2 R2
  `output/reports/name-1st-source-capital-south-bend-in/` 20/100 (SBIC mode,
  license gate PASS) — each with `lead-packet.json` + `.md` + `.html` on disk.
- **BLOCKING-s10-2 genuinely fixed.** Case-insensitive search of the drafts
  file for `1983|since|track record|durable|established|formation|years in
  business` returns **zero matches**. The OM-2 `[SPECIFIC_DETAIL]` line ("a
  licensed SBIC in good standing, pursuing a direct-lending investment
  strategy") traces to `sbic_license_status: "Good Standing"` and
  `sbic_gp_economics.strategy: "Direct Lending"` in the R2 packet. No
  operating-history / formation-date / vintage-as-history claim survives. The
  R2 report mentions `1983` only as the SBIC fund vintage, every time
  explicitly disclaiming it is the company formation date; Buy Box line 3 and
  the years-in-business rubric line both score 0 "insufficient data — not
  awarded" in both `.md` and `.html`.
- **Outreach drafts trace field-by-field to each packet.** OM-1 (R1): business
  name, recipient Pat Sample / Owner, location Anytown VA, "$480K in awards"
  (`federal_award_total: 480000`); missing email rendered "needs follow-up".
  OM-2 (R2): business name, recipient Ryan Fenstermaker / Investor Relations /
  fenstermakerr@1stsource.com, SBIC good-standing, direct-lending strategy,
  SBA-prior-approval fact — all trace to the R2 packet. No fabricated field.
- **Test context, not the live tracker.** Dry-run write-up + run log both record
  0 created / 0 updated; writes never directed at `tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS`.
- **Nothing auto-sent.** Both drafts carry the NOT-SENT / review-and-send-
  manually markers; the no-contact candidate was correctly skipped.
- **Same `prospect-evaluation` scorer, no new logic;** off-market "no asking
  price" handled as "insufficient data — not awarded" (R1 rubric line 81, R2
  rubric line 104), not a failure.

The critic raised two non-blocking notes, both already tracked — the stray
`</content>` token at drafts-file line 106 is NIT-s8-1; R1 being a synthetic
Class-1 fixture (no real S1-discovered company until the USAspending `uei` gap
closes) is IMPROVE-s6-2 / IMPROVE-s4-4, and the s10 `Done-when` explicitly
permits a fixture sample. No new findings filed.

Zero BLOCKING → stage s10 → `verified`. **All 10 stages are now `verified`.**
`unresolved_findings` unchanged at 29; `open_blockers` 0. Next phase: FINAL
AUDIT — a fresh independent auditor subagent audits the whole build end-to-end
against `OFFMARKET_BUILD_PLAN.md` and the PRD.

## iter 45 — 2026-05-22 — FINAL AUDIT — NO-SHIP

Fresh-context independent auditor subagent audited the whole build end-to-end
against `OFFMARKET_BUILD_PLAN.md` and the PRD. It independently inspected real
files, live Airtable state (`get_table_schema` of `tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS`), git
history, and live cron state (`CronList`, `launchctl`). Not given the loop's
logs or reasoning as truth.

**Verdict: NO-SHIP (1 BLOCKING).**

Confirmed PASS — seven deliverables and the honesty/constraint checks:
- The skill (`skill.md` + 8 reference files), the §9.1 nine-step workflow, and
  the manual single-entity path (`orchestration.md` §4, mirrors `submit-url`).
- `config/offmarket_sources.md` — 11 sources, NAICS 541930 / PSC R608, no
  `⚠ VERIFY:` placeholders.
- **Live Airtable schema** — `Source` carries both off-market values (exact
  U+2014 + spacing); the five §8.4 fields + `Gov Entity ID` exist with correct
  types; test row `recklDY7vHFmKauQD` is well-formed with no fabricated value.
- Dashboard off-market badge (`daily-dashboard.html:242,288,330`), on-market
  rows unchanged.
- Off-market outreach template distinct from the broker templates (git: broker
  file untouched by the off-market loop).
- **Honesty (highest-priority check):** both s10 lead packets read
  field-by-field against their `.md`/`.html` reports and outreach drafts — no
  fabricated field; BLOCKING-s10-1 and BLOCKING-s10-2 fixes both hold (SBIC
  fund vintage 1983 never rendered as company formation date / track record).
- Constraints: no parallel tracker; `prospect-evaluation/` has zero
  build-era commits (used verbatim); no auto-send path; fail-loud preflight;
  SBA prior-approval change-of-control fact on the Class-2 record/report/template.
- The auditor independently judged the fixture-shell adapter findings
  (`IMPROVE-s3-2/-s3-3/-s5-5`) **correctly classified IMPROVE, not BLOCKING** —
  the primary discovery sources (S1 USAspending, S4 SBA SBIC directory) are
  built for real and the shells degrade gracefully without fabricating.

**BLOCKING finding — BLOCKING-s9-1.** Build-plan deliverable #7 and the s9
`Done-when` both require the weekly `/schedule` cron to be **registered**.
`CronList` returns "No scheduled jobs" and `launchctl list | grep offmarket`
returns nothing — the cron is not live. The script, plist, and
`config/offmarket_schedule.md` all exist and are correct, but live
registration was gated on blocker B4; B4 is now RESOLVED, so the gate has
cleared and the registration step should have run. A scheduled pipeline that
is not scheduled is not done. Logged as **BLOCKING-s9-1** in `FINDINGS.md`.

Per the FINAL AUDIT contract, NO-SHIP → set the named stage back to
`not_started`. Stage **s9 → `not_started`**; `final_audit_passed` stays
`false`. `unresolved_findings` 29 → 30 (BLOCKING-s9-1 added). `open_blockers`
0. Next phase for s9: IMPLEMENT — register the weekly cron now that B4 is
resolved, then re-run SELF-TEST / VERIFY.

## iter 50 — 2026-05-22 — s9 (Orchestration & cadence) — VERIFY

Fresh-context critic subagent independently inspected the actual s9 artifacts
on disk and the live system state — `.claude/skills/off-market-search/skill.md`,
`references/orchestration.md`, `config/offmarket_schedule.md`,
`config/launchd/ai.earnedout.offmarket-search.plist` — and ran live
`launchctl list | grep offmarket` and `launchctl print` to confirm the weekly
agent. Not given the loop's logs or reasoning.

**Verdict: PASS (0 BLOCKING).**

All three Done-when criteria met:
- C1 — the skill runs the full pipeline. `skill.md` wires PRD §9.1 Steps 1–9
  end-to-end; `orchestration.md` §1–§2 specify run order, hand-off, and failure
  containment; the §1 hand-off table chains type-consistently. PASS.
- C2 — the manual single-entity path works. Documented `skill.md:193-205` and
  fully specified `orchestration.md` §4; mirrors `submit-url` (same Step 1
  preflight, seeds resolution directly, runs Steps 3–9 unchanged). PASS.
- C3 — the weekly cron is registered. Verified LIVE: `launchctl list` shows
  `ai.earnedout.offmarket-search`; `launchctl print gui/501/...` confirms
  `StartCalendarInterval` `Weekday => 1`, `Hour => 6`, `Minute => 0` (Monday
  06:00 local). The repo plist is byte-identical to the loaded
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` copy (`diff` clean), passes `plutil -lint`, and
  points at `run-offmarket-search.sh` (passes `bash -n`). Run-log format
  specified `orchestration.md` §3; Step 9 writes
  `search_reports/offmarket_run_log_YYYY-MM-DD.md`. PASS.

Constraint checks all PASS: no parallel tracker; no new scorer
(`prospect-evaluation` used verbatim); fail-loud Step 1 preflight; never
fabricate / never auto-send; the `skill.md` BUILD STATUS header honestly says
"WIRED, PENDING FINAL VERIFICATION" and does not claim the build is verified.

Findings (non-blocking, filed in `FINDINGS.md`):
- NIT — `orchestration.md:149` §5 dry-run mode cites B3/B4 as open (resolved).
  Already tracked as **NIT-s9-3** — not double-counted.
- NIT — `orchestration.md:26` §1 hand-off table lists a third `dedup_verdict`
  tag the enum omits. Already tracked as **NIT-s9-1** — not double-counted.
- NIT — `evidence/s9-offmarket_run_log_dryrun.md:11-12,53` — the frozen iter-26
  s9 dry-run evidence run log lists B4 as an open blocker / operator follow-up;
  B4 is RESOLVED. New finding: **NIT-s9-4**.

Stage s9 → `verified`. All 10 stages are now `verified`; next phase is FINAL
AUDIT. `unresolved_findings` 30 → 31 (NIT-s9-4 added). `open_blockers` 0.

## iter 51 — 2026-05-23 — FINAL AUDIT — SHIP

Fresh-context independent auditor subagent audited the whole `off-market-search`
build end-to-end against `OFFMARKET_BUILD_PLAN.md` and the PRD. It independently
inspected real files, live Airtable state (`get_table_schema` of
`tblSmNrHROMLm7vOS`), git history, and live cron state (`launchctl list` /
`launchctl print`). Not given the loop's logs or reasoning as truth — treated
all loop logs as claims.

**Verdict: SHIP (0 BLOCKING).**

All seven deliverables independently confirmed PASS:
- The skill (`skill.md` + 8 reference files); §9.1 nine-step workflow wired in
  fixed order 1→9; manual single-entity path (`orchestration.md` §4, mirrors
  `submit-url`).
- `config/offmarket_sources.md` — 11 sources S1–S11, NAICS 541930 / PSC R608,
  no `⚠ VERIFY:` placeholders, no fabricated codes/endpoints.
- **Live Airtable schema** — `Source` carries both off-market values with the
  exact U+2014 em dash (`0x2014` codepoint check) + spacing; the five §8.4
  fields + `Gov Entity ID` exist with correct types; test row
  `recklDY7vHFmKauQD` is well-formed with no fabricated value.
- Dashboard off-market badge (`daily-dashboard.html:242/288/330`, CSS line 155);
  the `<th>Source</th>` predates the build (`git blame` → on-market commit
  `2d49486`); on-market rows unchanged; no `Source` column added.
- Off-market outreach template (`config/offmarket_outreach_template.md`),
  distinct from the broker `config/outreach_templates.md` (git: zero
  `offmarket-build` commits to the broker file).
- Weekly cron LIVE — `launchctl` confirms `ai.earnedout.offmarket-search`
  scheduled `Weekday=1 Hour=6 Minute=0`; repo plist byte-identical to the loaded
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` copy (`diff` rc 0); `run-offmarket-search.sh` passes
  `bash -n`.
- **Honesty (highest-priority check):** both s10 lead packets read
  field-by-field against their `.md`/`.html` reports and outreach drafts — no
  fabricated field; the SBIC fund vintage 1983 is never rendered as a company
  formation date / operating track record (BLOCKING-s10-1 / BLOCKING-s10-2
  fixes both confirmed holding).

Constraints all PASS: no parallel tracker; `prospect-evaluation/` has zero
build-era commits (used verbatim); no auto-send path (every `send`/`smtp`/
`gmail`/`mailto` hit is a prohibition or the NOT-SENT marker); fail-loud schema
preflight; SBA prior-approval change-of-control fact on the Class-2
record/report/template.

The auditor independently re-judged the three fixture-shell adapter findings
(`IMPROVE-s3-2`/`-s3-3`/`-s5-5`) and concurred they are **correctly classified
IMPROVE, not BLOCKING** — the primary discovery sources (S1 USAspending, S4 SBA
SBIC directory) are built for real and the shells degrade gracefully without
fabricating. An IMPROVE/NIT backlog of 31 does not block ship.

**0 BLOCKING findings; no new findings filed.** Per the FINAL AUDIT contract,
SHIP with 0 BLOCKING → `final_audit_passed: true`. Stages stay all `verified`.
`unresolved_findings` unchanged at 31; `open_blockers` 0. Next phase: RESOLVE —
burn down the 31 open `IMPROVE`/`NIT` findings in `FINDINGS.md`, one per
iteration, before COMPLETE.
